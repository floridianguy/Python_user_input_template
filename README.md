This project shows code an option requesting a 'yes' or 'no'
from the user in order to show 5 lines of data from a large
Excel file.

It requires an import of the Python pandas module.

To test this particular case I used an Excel file that I created 
named 'list1.xlsx' that has 25 rows of data.  The code can be 
used as part of other, larger projects or by itself.
